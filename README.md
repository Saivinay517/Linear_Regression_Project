# Linear_Regression_Project
##To Predict the Heart attack disease for organization WHO (World Health Organization), using Machine Learning algorithm rate of heart attack disease will increasing manner or decreasing manner
# Project Statement:
##A world health organization eastimated 12 millons death data.One of them half of the death result is found in US.
##The research scholars point out the most relevent risk factor of heart attack.As a Data Science Engineer predict the overall risk using Machine Learning algorithm which ever them called as Logistic Regression.
# Task:
## 1.Import the libraries which is required for prediction
## 2.import the dataset your using workspace
## 3.Use the apporipriate argument of sklearn library to train ,test and split the dataset
## 4.Fit your values with arange function using FeatureScaling
## 5.Check your model accuracy and precision using confusion matrix
